Input file: prostate_variants_tabnet.csv
Output file: prostate_variants_tabnet_enhanced.csv

ENHANCEMENT SUMMARY:
Total variants: 193,278
AlphaMissense coverage: 83,702 variants (43.3%)
File size: 153.5 MB

DATA LEAKAGE ELIMINATION:
❌ REMOVED artificial features:
  - sift_confidence (artificial binary flags)
  - polyphen_confidence (artificial binary flags)
  - functional_pathogenicity (composite artificial score)

✅ ADDED legitimate features:
  - alphamissense_pathogenicity (0-1 pathogenicity score)
  - alphamissense_class (Likely_Pathogenic/Ambiguous/Likely_Benign)

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE IMPACT:
- Eliminates 100% artificial accuracy from data leakage
- Expected realistic accuracy: 75-85% (clinically appropriate)
- Maintains interpretability with legitimate functional scores
- Provides state-of-the-art pathogenicity predictions

NEXT STEPS:
1. Use prostate_variants_tabnet_enhanced.csv for TabNet training
2. Include alphamissense_pathogenicity as primary functional feature
3. Use alphamissense_class for interpretability analysis
4. Validate model achieves 75-85% accuracy (no more data leakage)
5. Proceed with clinical variant classification research
