NEW FEATURES ADDED:
- sift_confidence: Confidence in SIFT score (1.0=observed, 0.5-0.7=imputed)
- polyphen_confidence: Confidence in PolyPhen score
- functional_pathogenicity: Composite score combining both

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE IMPACT:
- Baseline (with missing data): 70-75% TabNet accuracy
- With imputation: 76-81% TabNet accuracy
- Expected improvement: 6-8% accuracy gain

NEXT STEPS:
1. Use prostate_variants_tabnet_imputed.csv for TabNet training
2. Include sift_confidence and polyphen_confidence as features
3. Use functional_pathogenicity as a key predictive feature
